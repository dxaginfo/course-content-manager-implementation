# Course Content Manager Deployment Guide

This guide provides step-by-step instructions for deploying the Course Content Manager web application using the Lovable platform.

## Prerequisites

Before deploying, ensure you have:

1. A Lovable platform account with publishing permissions
2. The finalized Course Content Manager application code
3. Any necessary assets (images, videos, etc.) ready for upload

## Deployment Steps

### 1. Prepare Your Application

Ensure your application is ready for deployment:

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Build the production version
npm run build
```

This will create a `dist` directory with optimized files ready for deployment.

### 2. Access the Lovable Platform

1. Navigate to [Lovable Dashboard](https://lovable.ai/dashboard)
2. Sign in with your credentials
3. Select "Course Content Manager" from your projects list

### 3. Configure Deployment Settings

In the project dashboard:

1. Select the "Settings" tab
2. Verify the following settings:
   - Project name: "Course Content Manager"
   - Deployment path: "/course-content-manager-ag7"
   - Build command: "npm run build"
   - Build output directory: "dist"
   - Environment variables (if needed)

### 4. Deploy the Application

1. From the project dashboard, click on "Share" in the top navigation
2. From the dropdown menu, select "Publish"
3. In the publish dialog:
   - Confirm deployment settings
   - Add a deployment message (e.g., "Initial production deployment")
   - Click "Publish"

The platform will build and deploy your application. This process typically takes 2-5 minutes.

### 5. Verify Deployment

Once deployment is complete:

1. Click on the provided deployment URL: [https://lovable.ai/publish/course-content-manager-ag7](https://lovable.ai/publish/course-content-manager-ag7)
2. Verify all features are working correctly:
   - Course section navigation
   - FAQ functionality
   - Content display
   - Responsive design on different devices
   - Progress tracking

### 6. Sharing Access

To share access with course students:

1. From the project dashboard, select "Access" tab
2. Choose one of the following options:
   - Public access: Enable "Public" toggle
   - Restricted access: Add email addresses under "Invite Users"
3. Set appropriate permission levels
4. Click "Save Changes"

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues during deployment:

1. **Build Failures**:
   - Check build logs in the Lovable dashboard
   - Verify all dependencies are correctly installed
   - Ensure environment variables are properly configured

2. **Runtime Errors**:
   - Use browser developer tools to identify JavaScript errors
   - Check for console warnings and errors
   - Verify API endpoints and data sources are accessible

3. **Content Display Issues**:
   - Confirm all assets are properly uploaded
   - Check image paths and formats
   - Verify media file compatibility

## Post-Deployment Tasks

After successful deployment:

1. Monitor application performance
2. Collect user feedback
3. Plan for future updates and improvements
4. Document any observed issues for future fixes
